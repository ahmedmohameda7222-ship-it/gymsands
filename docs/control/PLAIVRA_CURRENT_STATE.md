# Plaivra Current State

## Last audited runtime baseline

- Last audited application/runtime baseline before PCS-1:
  `main@525982e33920d2a94a15b875993850a4877aa8a5`
- At the time of the audit, Production reported the same commit and `/api/version` returned HTTP 200.
- PCS-1 changes documentation and project governance only; it does not change application runtime behavior.
- Exact current Git and Production identities must be verified from GitHub `main` and Production `/api/version`. Do not infer them from this historical audit snapshot.

## Compatibility state verified during the PCS-1 audit

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| schemaCompatibilityVersion | `2` |
| expectedDatabaseMigrationVersion | `20260724232734` |
| databaseMigrationVersion | `20260724232734` |
| latest physical Production migration | `20260802114733` |
| migrationLedgerReconciliationState | `reconciled` |
| pendingMigrationCount | `0` |
| schemaAppliedUntrackedCount | `0` |
| unresolvedMigrationCount | `0` |
| migrationVersionCompatible | `true` |
| migrationLedgerReconciled | `true` |
| releaseReady | `true` |

These values describe the verified audit baseline. Any later runtime, migration, or release change must update this document in the same approved change.

## PCS-2 Production migration reconciliation

| Field | Verified value |
|---|---|
| Production project | `bkwezjxvapaeasfvlhvv` |
| immutable repository migration | `20260803152000_private_app_bootstrap_v1.sql` |
| generated Production identity | `20260803173755_private_app_bootstrap_v1` |
| Production migration count | `86` |
| applied exactly once | `true` |
| latest physical Production migration | `20260803173755_private_app_bootstrap_v1` |
| ledger classification | `applied_version_alias` |
| pendingMigrationCount | `0` |
| schemaAppliedUntrackedCount | `0` |
| unresolvedMigrationCount | `0` |
| migrationLedgerReconciliationState | `reconciled` |
| released compatibility marker | `20260724232734` |
| application deployment accompanied migration application | `false` |

The PCS-2 migration application did not deploy application code and did not promote the compatibility marker. Application deployment occurred later, after the approved squash merge.

## PCS-2 Production runtime closure

| Field | Verified value |
|---|---|
| approved PR head | `99c675692d1411c8296d6817a983e379d8c65a36` |
| squash merge / current Production commit | `92d936bc513af83fff41913477a8148a9ab5b845` |
| Vercel deployment | `dpl_DbSrbwJ98HiuZTJQFW7G3hVtkVZy` |
| deployment target | `production` |
| deployment state | `READY` |
| build timestamp | `2026-08-03T18:07:46.883Z` |
| Production `/api/version` status | `200` |
| schemaCompatibilityVersion | `2` |
| expectedDatabaseMigrationVersion | `20260724232734` |
| databaseMigrationVersion | `20260724232734` |
| migrationLedgerReconciliationState | `reconciled` |
| pendingMigrationCount | `0` |
| schemaAppliedUntrackedCount | `0` |
| unresolvedMigrationCount | `0` |
| migrationVersionCompatible | `true` |
| migrationLedgerReconciled | `true` |
| releaseReady | `true` |
| schemaCompatible | `true` |
| Production login route | `200` |
| compute region | `fra1` |
| runtime-error clusters during closure verification | `0` |

PCS-2 is merged, deployed, Production-verified, and closed. The deployed application commit matches `main`, the migration ledger is reconciled, the compatibility marker remains unchanged, and no post-deployment runtime error cluster was detected during the closure verification window.

## PCS-3A implementation candidate

PCS-3A corrects the Workout History browser request lifecycle without changing server canonical rules or database objects. The candidate makes the URL the committed list-query authority, uses a canonical owner/query key for first-page identity, deduplicates same-key in-flight work, keeps cursor pagination independent, and passes the current AuthProvider access token explicitly to normal list and detail requests.

PCS-3A is not closed. Closure still requires Product & Engineering Lead QA/QC, Ahmed's explicit approval, squash merge, automatic application deployment, and Production request-count verification. PCS-3B Today projection remains planned. PCS-3 as a whole is not complete.

## Current program

- PCS-1 Repository Control Plane — complete.
- PCS-2 Private App Bootstrap — complete and Production-verified.
- PCS-3 Request Architecture — in progress; PCS-3A Workout History Request Stability is the current implementation candidate and PCS-3B Today projection remains planned.
- PCS-4 CI Operating Model — planned.
- PCS-5 Production Foundation — planned.

## Feature maturity

| Capability | Classification | Confirmed note |
|---|---|---|
| Authentication / account / onboarding | Functional | Private startup converged through the PCS-2 bootstrap authority |
| Workouts plans and execution | Strong | — |
| Active Workout offline and multi-device | Strong | — |
| Workout History | Strong | PCS-3A request-stability correction is an unclosed implementation candidate |
| Muscle Intelligence and Heat Maps | Strong | Strong foundation |
| Today | Functional | Request-waterfall debt; PCS-3B remains planned |
| Nutrition and food logging | Functional | Transactional-convergence debt |
| Meal planning | Functional | — |
| Hydration | Functional | — |
| Progress and body measurements | Functional | — |
| Progress photos | Functional | Delete-compensation debt |
| Wellness, sleep, habits, supplements | Functional | Fragmented product presentation |
| Daily Tasks | Partial | Product relationship with Today is unresolved |
| My Recipes | Partial | Foundation exists; standalone product experience is not implemented |
| Notifications | Scaffold | Preferences exist but no delivery engine |
| PDF reports | Partial | Grocery PDF exists; general reporting does not |
| Activity Catalog external service | Scaffold | Inactive; current provider is legacy |
| Billing | Scaffold | Disabled |
| MCP / OAuth / ChatGPT connection | Strong | Strong foundation |
| Privacy export and account deletion | Strong | Strong foundation |
| Product analytics | Partial | — |
| Operational monitoring and alerts | Partial | — |
| PWA | Absent | — |
| Native iOS and Android applications | Absent | — |
| Final launch landing page | Partial | — |

Allowed maturity classifications are `Strong`, `Functional`, `Partial`, `Scaffold`, `Absent`, and `Decision Required`.

## Confirmed highest-priority technical findings

1. PCS-2 consolidated duplicated private application startup work through one Production-verified bootstrap authority.
2. Workout History repeated-request debt is addressed by the unclosed PCS-3A implementation candidate and still requires Lead QA/QC, merge, deployment, and Production request verification.
3. Today performs a broad client-side request waterfall.
4. Different domains have different reliability maturity; Workouts is stronger than Nutrition.
5. CI and test scripts retain phase-based duplication and are too slow for daily development.
6. Current Supabase organization is on the Free plan and is not final-launch infrastructure.
7. Repository planning documents were stale and were not a reliable current-state authority.
